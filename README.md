# ATLA-fan-game-
The git repo of an ATLA fan game in the making. This is nowhere near official and is made by a complete dev noob. But we'll see how it goes


The idea of the project is to create a game about the main storyline in the Nickelodeon series Avatar the Last Airbender. The game follows Aang, a young airbender who will turn out to be te Avatar, on his adventures with his friends. Who might later also be added as playable characters.
